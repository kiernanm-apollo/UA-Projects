# UA-Projects
These are projects that I have made during my academic career at the University of Arizona throughout different classes. 
Each one was completed by myself or with a partner to answer questions using cleaned and uncleaned data. 
At the same time integrating concepts of the class to help answer these quesitons with the data.
